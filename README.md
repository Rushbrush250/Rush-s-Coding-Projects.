# Rush's Coding Projects

## Code Chronicles
Welcome to my repository, here you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments, milestones 
and whatever else I want to post here. My goal is to become an expert ML/AI developer which includes knowing python,
and python libraries like numpy and pandas. Also being good at Data Structures and Algorithms, machine learning, deep learning,
and probably more. You can think of these projects as an output and showcase of my progress.

## Notes
I will currently be posting less projects as I focus on leetcode and understanding Data Structures and Algorithms (aka DSA).
When i'm done which will be when i've feel like I've sufficiently I learned DSA, I will start going back to 
consistently posting projects, more specifically machine learning projects.
