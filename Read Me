OK this is not my first project, but it is definitely going to be One of my earliest.

While this is a read me, and it's supposed to be at about the project, im not going to be talking about it.
I'm going to be more about my experience doing this.

Coding this was pretty tough, I am learning about python and I am enjoying it, but this really opened my eyes into what coding is.
Yes coding is about actually coding, but it's also about problem solving. And that's what made me enjoy coding this project.
This gave me insight into what coding is really about.
There's this random quote about coding that really explains this perfectly.
Coding is not about knowing how to code, coding is about knowing how to know.
You see I just realized that I am never going to learn all of coding, let alone python with all of it's extensive library.
However what I am going to become an expert at is know how to find the right thing to code better and faster.
And debugging... lot's of debugging.
